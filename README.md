# Python test migration
Please implement following set of classes in Python.

Class Workload that contains following fields:
IP string, credentials of type Credentials
Storage that contains list of instances of type MountPoint

Class Credentials that contains the following fields
Username - string
Password - string
Domain - string

Class MountPoint that contains the following fields:
Mount point name - string - Example: “c:\”
Total size of the mount point - int

Add following business constraints to class Workload:
Username, password, IP should not be None
IP cannot change for the specific workload
You cannot have more than one source with the same IP

Class MigrationTarget that contains following fields:
Cloud Type: aws, azure, vsphere, vcloud - no other types are allowed
Cloud Credentials of type Credentials
Target Vm object of type Workload

Define class Migration that contains the following
Selected Mount points: list of MountPoint
Source of type WorkloadMigrationTarget of type MigrationTarget
Migration state: not started, running, error, success
Implement run() method - run method should sleep for X min (simulate running migration) copy source object to the MigrationTarget.TargetVM and target should only have mount points that are selected. For example, if source has: C:\ D: and E:\ and only C: was selected, target should only have C:\

Implement business logic to not allow running migrations when volume C:\ is not allowed

Implement persistence layer to allow to save all those classes into filesystem. It should allow to create, update, read and delete objects.

The solution should work on Linux. Assume that you are writing production quality code - same quality and same coding standards, packaging, code and package structure. Provide unit testing and all scripts that are necessary to package and test.
